## Objective: Build a a wireless custom general-purpose controller project
- The custom controller's name is Bossy
- Build a custom controller with parts I already have at home

### Preliminaries

- [x] .List bill of materials
- [x] .Install arduino
- [x] .Install fritzing
- [x] .Test if Arduino Micro is working
- [x] .Make continuity tester with adafruit metro mini
- [x] .Find out unique values of up, down and neutral for each joystick
- [x] .Verify connectivity of switches, potentiometer, and momentary buttons
- [x] .Finalize breadboard schematic, pcb design

### Breadboard tests

- [x] .Test 8x8 Led matrix on Arduino Micro
- [x] .Check if the two arduino micro can communicate using nrf24l01
- [x] .Test multiplexers with potentiometers

### Soldered Protoboard test
- [x] .Solder led matrix, potentiometers, joysticks
- [x] .Solder buttons and resistors
- [x] .Test connectivity and routes on stripboard
- [x] .Solder switches
- [x] .Test switches
- [x] .Solder wires to connect multiplexer to components
- [x] .Test multiplexers with components
- [x] .Test wireless connection
- [x] .Test led matrix

### Coding and finishing up

- [x] .Make a class wrapper for elegantly reading, processing, and accessing the input signals
- [x] .Add UI functionality for providing feedback of controls in the 8x8 led matrix (screen)
- [x] .Send commands by user from controller to receiver.
-
- Make an enclosure to house our controller
