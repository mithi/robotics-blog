## Objective: Build a a wireless custom general-purpose controller project
- The custom controller's name is Bossy
- Build a custom controller with parts I already have at home


### Preliminaries

- [x] .List bill of materials
- [x] .Install arduino
- [x] .Install fritzing
- [x] .Test Arduino micro is working
- [x] .Make continuity tester with adafruit metro mini
- [x] .Find out uniqe values of up, down and neutral for each joystick
- [x] .Verify connectivity of switches, potentiometer, and momentary buttons
- [x] .Finalize breadboard schematic, pcb design

### Breadboard tests

- [x] .Test 8x8 Led matrix on Arduino Micro
- Check if the two arduino micro  can communicate

### Soldered Protoboard test
- [x] .Solder led matrix, potentiometers, joysticks
- Solder buttons and switches
- Test led matrix
- Test multiplexer #1 with joysticks
- Test multiplexer #2 with potentiometers, buttons, switches
- Test wireless connection

### Coding and finishing up

- Add UI functionality for provide feedback of controls in the 8x8 led matrix (screen)
- Make an enclosure to house our controller
- Use controller to control the neopixels wirelessly
