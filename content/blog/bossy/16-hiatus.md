I'll be taking a little time away from Bossy.
I have many features in store for it but right now
because of the extreme lockdown in my city, I'm unable to get
the parts I need for the second prototype.

In the section "Dreams of Shopping" of my
[Wish List](https://mithi.github.io/robotics-blog/wish-list/), I included screenshots of what I'm going to buy next all of which will be shipped from China. Totalling around ~60 USD
including tools for future use that are not related to Bossy.
I also need to buy a soldering iron and other tools.
